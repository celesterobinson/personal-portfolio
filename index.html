    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm only 8 months into my coding journey. I have learned HTML5 and CSS3, and am currently working hard at Javascript and jQuery. Outside of programming, I am a professional trumpet player. I've loved learning these new languages and the way they communicate to users and with each other. I live in Orem UT, and am currently a self-employed musician while also practicing code as many hours a day as I can.</p>
        <p>My first site is now live. It's still a work in progress, but feel free to <a href="http://www.thesaltlakecity7.com" target="_blank">check it out!</p>
